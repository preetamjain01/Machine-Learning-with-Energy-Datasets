    "Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Tall buildings and skyscrapers accounts for 30% of total electricity consumption. This gave wide spectrum to data analyst to analyze this scenario which can be exercised through engineering methods. There are 2 major methods which are as follows: (1) AI based method also called as the black box predicts energy use without knowing the internal relationship of the building and the individual components. (2) Hybrid is called as grey box which requires detailed building information for simulation for model development.\n",

    "There are 2 prediction methods which are widely used for energy systems. They are as follows: (1) Single Prediction – utilize one learning algorithm (2) Ensemble Prediction – integrate some of the single prediction to improve accuracy of prediction.\n",

    "There are many parameters which can be used for predicting energy usage by buildings like building type which can be commercial, residential, educational or research. We can assume them to be one among educational, research or commercial due to availability of data. Residential building has privacy issues. The predicting model used for energy usage varied from one prediction algorithm to ensemble. Ensemble model is preferred due to its demonstrated superiority over one prediction after much research and development into it over the years. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used because of ease of implementation and reliable prediction performance besides regression, SVR, ARMAX, CHAID for building energy use prediction. The energy type was divided into 5 categories i.e whole building energy/electricity (35%), heating and cooling energy (11%), heating energy (11%), cooling energy (13%) and all others (8%). Other considerable parameter was Prediction time scale which represents the time resolution of the prediction which is often impacted by the sampling interval of sensors and the research. Preferred time scale was Hour (49%), Day (19%), Year (8%) and Other (24% - min-by-min, week, month). Based on knowledge researchers collect data. Meteorology (60%), Occupancy(29%), Other(54%). Different patterns could be identified and analyzed.\n",

    "The various AI-based prediction models involve methods like Data collection, data preprocessing, model training and model testing. In the single prediction method, I use multiple linear regression where inputs consists of shape factor, envelope U-value, window-to-floor area ratio, building time constant and climate which is defined as a function of sol-air temperature and heating set-point. These models were easy and efficient forecast tools for calculating heating demand of residential buildings. Catalina et al. simplified the MLR model by introducing only three inputs namely, building global heat loss coefficient, south equivalent surface, and the difference between the indoor set point temperature and sol-air temperature. Their results indicated that the proposed method closely predicted future building heat demand. Jacob et al. improved the performance of regression model by introducing the rate of change of the indoor air temperature as an independent variable. Their study indicated that the performance of MLR could be improved by introducing appropriate independent variables. In ANN, a nonlinear statistical technique which consists of Input, output and hidden layers interconnected. Ben-Nakhi and Mahmoud applied General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) to predict the cooling load for commercial buildings. Multiple results show ANNs could perform better than regression method for short-term forecasting. To detect complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs implicitly which is good for real time monitoring. However, ANN method fails to establish any interconnection relationship between building physical parameters and building energy use, which limits the model's fitting ability when changes are made to building components or systems. In Support Vector Regression where input data is mapped via a nonlinear function. It finds the most deviation from the obtained target. Selection of kernel function is important as it affects the learning ability of SVR. SVR demonstrates its ability to predict hourly cooling load in the building. SVR helps in optimization\n",

    "In the Ensemble prediction method, the aim is to provide best possible prediction performance by automatically managing the strengths and weaknesses of each base model. It has multiple learning models depending on base model resampling, manipulation or randomization of training data, learning algorithm and parameters. Ensemble models can be Homogenous and Heterogenous models. Homogenous model uses bagging and boosting. The various ways to implement it is firstly via Input feature identification, Data monitoring and preprocessing, Learning algorithm selection, Base model generation, Model integration.\n",

    "Proposed by Hansen and Salamon 1990 to solve classification problems. They state that the collective decision produced by the ensemble model is less likely to be in error than the decision made by any of the individual models. Multiple classification algorithms and integration schemes were used to develop ensemble models. heterogeneous ensemble classifier that consisted of five different classification algorithms to solve health-related short text classification problem. A parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out to obtain the best possible features. Multiple model integration schemes such as multi-staging, reverse multi-staging, majority voting, and weighted probability averaging were used to combine the classification results of the base classifiers. The result indicated that the proposed ensemble classifier performs better than the single SVM classifier in the studied problem. Three combination techniques such as the majority voting, the LSE-based weighting, and the double-layer hierarchical combining were used to aggregate the individual SVMs. Three typical classification problems: data classification, handwritten digit recognition, and fraud detection were used to test the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model.\n",

    "Their results indicated that the ensemble model outperforms single SVM model in terms of classification accuracy which is performed on buildings around the globe."
