    "Abstract\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents and discusess data-driven predictive models for the energy use of appliances. Data used include measurements of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather from a nearby airport station and recorded energy use of lighting fixtures. The paper discusses data filtering to remove non-predictive parameters and feature ranking.\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The electricity consumption in domestic buildings is explained by two main factors: the type and number of electrical appliances and the use of the appliances by the occupants. The occupancy level of the building in different locations could also help to determine the use of the appliances. Specifically, data from a nearby airport weather station, temperature and humidity in different rooms in the house from a wireless sensor network and one sub-metered electrical energy consumption have been used to predict the energy use by appliances. Four regression models have been tested, namely (a) multiple linear regression model(lm), (b) support vector machine with radial basis function kernel(SVM-radial), (c) random forest(RF) and (d) gradient boosting machines(GBM) with different combinations of predictors.\n",

    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This section reviews some articles regarding modeling of appliances and other socio economic factors that help to understand the different data and methodologies that have been used in the pastto understand appliances’ energy use.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.2 Electricity load prediction\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "    \n",
    "This section presents and discusses research addressing electricity load prediction to identify the parameters, models and other methods that have been useful for energy prediction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Models such as multiple regression, neural networks, forecasting methods, engineering methods, support vector machines, time series techniques and forecasting methods have been used to predict the electricity demand. The models usually have considered parameters such as the time of day, outdoor temperature, month, weekend, holidays, yesterday’s consumption, rainfall index, global solar radiation, wind speed and occupancy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the data available to the researchers, an extensive list of variables was studied: weather, location (ZIP code), age of building, ownership, presence of double pane windows, energy efficient light fixtures, floor area, pet ownership, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices, number of occupants and income level were studied. The researchers concluded that the most important variables were weather, location,and floor area. Also the number of refrigerators and entertainment appliances are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption. Another study found that being at home during the day correlated with lower appliance efficiency. The provided explanation by theresearchers is the lower efficiency was likely due to the increaseduse of appliances when the house is occupied more often.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A prediction system for the problem of individual appliance prediction was presented in. The system used information such as past consumption, hour, day, season and month. The system is capable of learning from past data. One of the main conclusions was that the last 24 h are the most relevant for prediction.\n",

    "1.2 Research objectives and methodology outline\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this work is to understand the relationships between appliances energy consumption and different predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. House description\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A house located in Stambruges is taken into consideration for analyzing the aggregated electric energy consumption per month. The house temperature and humidity conditions were moni-tored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recorded data and description\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy (Wh) data logged every 10 min for the appliances is the focus of this analysis. The 10 min reporting interval was chosen to be able to capture quick changes in energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Data sets and exploratory analysis\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined data set is split in training and test validation using CARET’S(Classification and Regression Training Package) create data partition function. 75% of the data is used for the training of the models and the rest is used for testing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.2 Data features filtering and importance\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Boruta package is used here to select all the relevant variables. Several researchers have used this package for variable filtering. To test the Boruta algorithm, two random variables were introduced in the data sets. Moreover, this feature or variable selection helps in model interpretability and reduces complexity of the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Boruta package compares importance of attributes with importance of shadow attributes that are created by shuffling original ones. The Boruta algorithm is capable of detecting the two random variables that have no predicting power for the appliances’ energy consumption.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To test how many variables are optimal to minimize the RMSE the recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used to select the optimal inputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.3 The performance of regression models\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "    \n",
    "In order to compare the performance of each of the regression models, different performance evaluation indices are used here: the root mean squared error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination or R-squared/R2, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.4 Model selection\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The best models are the ones that provide the lower RMSE and highest R-square values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the models, the time information was ranked as the most important to predict the appliances’ consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using all the predictors the light consumption was ranked highly. However, when studying different predictor subsets, removing the light consumption appeared not to have a significant impact. This may be an indication that other features are correlated well with the light energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study has found curious relationships between variables. Future work could include considering weather data such as solar radiation and precipitation."
